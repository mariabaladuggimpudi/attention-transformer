The preprocessing step in Natural Language Processing (NLP) has the following steps:

1) Tokenization
2) Stemming
3) Lemmatization

Using the above 3 preprocessing techniques we can say that we are normalizing the text.
Typically the first step is tokenization, and there are different types of tokenization techniques. It's only after the
tokenization depending on the NLP task Stemming and Lemmatization is used. Some of the different types of tokenization are as follows:

1) Word Tokenization
2) Sentence Tokenization: Typically it is used for text summarization.
3) Subword Tokenization: Breaking words into small linguistic units.
4) Character Tokenization:
5) Byte-Pair Encoding
6) Whitespace Tokenization:
7) BERT Tokenization:
8) SentencePiece Tokenization:
9) WorkPiece Tokenization:

Some of the important tokenizations are:
WordPiece, SentencePiece, Byte-Pair Encoding.
